# Blockchain Project: CSE242

This project was done as part of the CSE242: Blockchain Algorithms and Systems course. It consists of several Solidity smart contracts created on Remix.

## Smart Contracts

1. **AsaToken.sol**: Creates an ERC20 token named AsaToken. It contains an initial mint and a `mintMe` function allowing additional mints.

2. **Exchange.sol**: Smart contract used to define liquidity by depositing both Ether and ERC20 tokens. Users can deposit, withdraw, swap Ether and ERC20 tokens. It maintains balances as well.

3. **Hawkoin.sol**: Creates an ERC20 token named Hawkoin. It contains an initial mint and a `mintMe` function allowing additional mints.

4. **KorthCoin.sol**: Creates an ERC20 token named KorthCoin. It contains an initial mint and a `mintMe` function allowing additional mints.
